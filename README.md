# DjangoReact App

# This repository will be my following of [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLRM7ROnmA9FxCtnLoIHAs6hIkJyd1dEx)

# Notes
    - The initial master upload will be my solution after video 1 and with the additional form to be able to create an 
    article.
        - My initial solution does not require the user to be logged in to create an article. This will be fixed in a 
        later upload.
        - My initial solution for the update is not ideal because I had to create another component which is very similar
        the ArticleCreateView except it sends a put request instead of a post request.
        - My initial deletion solution does not require for the user to be logged in and to be the owener of the article.
        I will work towards resolving this issue with a later upload.
